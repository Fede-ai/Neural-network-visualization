# Neural-network-visualization

In this SFML and c++ project i've implemented a simple neural network with flexible size. 
You can change the values of the network's biases and weights through some sliders.

By pressing the space button you can toggle the neural network with an image created by feeding the coordinates of each pixel to the neural network.
The first layer has a fixed size of 2 neurons while the last one has eighter a size of 2 neurons (if you want a black and white image) or a size of 3 neurons (if you want a colored image).
You can decide the size of the neural network at the start of the program (the process is explained step-by-step in the console). 

You can move around using the mouse wheel to zoom and the mouse cursor to move up, down left or right. 
By pressing 'c' you will automatically place the neural network/image at the center of the screen.
